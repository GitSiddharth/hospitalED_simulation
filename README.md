# hospitalED_simulation

## How to Use This Project

1. **AnyLogic Model:**  
   Open the `.alp` file in the `simulation/` folder using AnyLogic Personal Edition (or a compatible version). Run the simulation to observe the ED process and the impact of RL-based decisions.

2. **Documentation:**  
   - The PDF flowchart provides an overview of the process flow.
   - The LaTeX file contains the research paper that describes the model, methodology, and results.

3. **Customization:**  
   You can modify simulation parameters (e.g., arrival rates, treatment durations, severity thresholds) directly in the AnyLogic model. The RL agentâ€™s logic is implemented via custom Java code within the model.

## Requirements

- **AnyLogic Personal Edition** (or compatible version)  
- Basic knowledge of Java for custom code modifications  
- LaTeX distribution (optional, for compiling the research paper)
